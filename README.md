![Hi, I'm Timothy Halim]

Hi, I'm Timothy. Pipeline TD from Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. Currently working in ILM, where the magic happens. I'm also an artist, and previously worked as a Lighting and Compositing Supervisor. My skills are a good mix of art and technology, because I like to speed up me and my team content creation workflows. It always makes me happy to be able to help the team work easier.

Currently learning about Web Development using fast-api, react and mongo aka FARM.
