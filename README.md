![Hi, I'm Timothy Halim]

Hi, I'm Timothy. I'm currently a Pipeline TD in Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. I'm also an artist, and previously worked as a Lighting and Compositing Supervisor. My skills are a good mix of art and technology, because I like to speed up my and my team content creation workflows. It always makes me happy to be able to help the team work easier.

Currently learning about C++ and developing pipeline for blender.
